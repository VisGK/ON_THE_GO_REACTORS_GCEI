# ON_THE_GO_REACTORS_GCEI
At its core, our proposal seeks to address the challenge of transporting feedstock for bioprocessing efficiently and sustainably. We focus on integrating fermentation processes into transportation infrastructure. We want to make sure that every step of the journey, from farm to factories is as efficient and eco-friendly as possible. By doing this, we're not just making things easier for ourselves but we're also unlocking the potential of bio-based materials like PHA, which can make a big difference in the world of eco-friendly packaging.
Our solution integrating rectors with transportation also includes trucks, trains and if the situation is right even on ships. The reactors that we provide have all the technology to smoothly run the fermentation while being transported and with limited human interference.

Benefits:
1. Lower Carbon emissions
2. Continues process
3. Increasing bio process efficiency

Along with all these benefits our solution the degradation of the feedstock during transportation is almost negligible as the process starts at the farm or the source of the feedstock. This gives us a chance to implement our technology while the Farmers get a new opportunity to sell their crops and processing plants to save money on transportation. But making this vision a reality won't be easy. It's going to take a lot of resources, time, money, and effort. We'll need to invest in research, upgrade our infrastructure, and get everyone on board with the plan. It's a big undertaking, but with the right timeline and budget in place, we're confident we can make it happen with our diverse team of engineers.
We are confident that this project presents a unique opportunity for sustainable growth across various industries. To turn this vision into reality, we invite potential partners and investors to join us in shaping the future of bioprocessing and next gen reactors.
